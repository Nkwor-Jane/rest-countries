## About the project

This is another Frontend Mentor challenge I built. 
This is my solution to the REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor. 
The goal of this challenge was to integrate the [REST Countries V2 API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2)
 to pull country data and display it as shown in the UI/UX designs.

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click on the border countries to view details about them
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
- Scroll Up button after scrolling down(300px)
